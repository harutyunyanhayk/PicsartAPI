# PicsartAPI
Project to automate '{JSON} Placeholder'


Functional automation for API testing. Write a test in Java following the REST API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
Requirements:
1.	Get a random user (userID) and print out their email address to the console.
2.	Using this userID, get the userâ€™s associated posts and verify they contain valid Post IDs (an integer between 1 and 100).
3.	Create a post using the same userID with a non-empty title and body, and verify the correct response is returned.

Used "io.restassured.RestAssured" and "io.restassured.response.Response" libs to make request-response for comleting requirements.
